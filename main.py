welcome_text = """
Welcome to Interstate 20, 285, and A Couple Roads in Texas! You have decided that YOU want
to live on the beautiful shores of CADDO LAKE (or maybe in a houseboat? You saw a cool ad for those).
Your goal is to travel by Toyota Corolla from Atlanta, GA to Caddo Lake (a distance of 600 miles).
The highway is car-azy! Each day costs you food and health (because fast food, right?).
Anyway, you can eat more fast food and stop at a rest area, but you have to get to Caddo Lake
before the timer RUNS OUT (15 minutes)!!!! (Otherwise, INFLATION happens and the properties become SUPER EXPENSIVE [BUT INFLATION MIGHT ALREADY BE HAPPENING! INFLATION IS A BALLOON!!!!!]).
"""

help_text = """
Each turn you can take one of 3 actions:

  CAR TRIP - moves you randomly between 20-200 miles and takes
           2-3 days (random). You are currently listning to Bill Bryson's Into The Woods.
  Rest Area   - increases a different number of health levels depending on your healthiness (Max: 10) and takes
           2-5 days (random).
  Buy Fast Food   - adds 50 lbs of food to your store of CHEEEEEEEEEZZZZ SNAUCKS and takes 1-2 days (random).

When prompted for an action, you can also enter one of these
commands without using up your turn:

  status - lists food, health, distance traveled, and day.
  help   - lists all the commands.
  quit   - will end the game.
  
You can also use these shortcuts for commands:

  'q' for CAR TRIP, 'w' for Rest Area, 'e' for Buy Fast Food, 'r' for status, 't' for help, 'y' for quit
